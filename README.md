## 📋 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart failure in patients using machine learning. Early detection of heart conditions can save lives by allowing for timely medical intervention. Using clinical data from patients, we developed a model to assess heart failure risk based on various health indicators.

### 🌟 Why Heart Failure Prediction?
Heart failure is a critical health issue globally. By predicting potential risks, healthcare providers can focus on preventive care, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **High Accuracy Model**: Uses machine learning techniques for reliable heart failure predictions.
- **Explainable AI**: Integrates SHAP values to make model predictions interpretable for clinicians.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Allows healthcare providers to input patient data and receive predictions instantly.

## 📊 Model Training and Data
- **Dataset**: The dataset contains clinical information about patients such as age, blood pressure, and other heart health metrics.
- **Model Used**: Gradient Boosting Classifier, with tuning via GridSearchCV to optimize performance.
- **Evaluation**: Achieved an accuracy of over 85% and an AUC score of 0.92.
